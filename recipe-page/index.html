        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup whole milk, warm</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup powdered sugar, for dusting</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2> INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <h4>MAKE THE DOUGH</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm milk and active dry 
                yeast. Whisk together until the yeast is dissolved. Allow it to 
                sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
            </li>
            <li>
                To the yeast mixture, add the granulated white sugar, salt, 
                eggs, softened unsalted butter, and vanilla extract. Mix well 
                until all the ingredients are combined. 
            </li>
            <li> 
                Gradually add the all-purpose flour to the mixture, stirring 
                continuously until a dough forms. It will be very soft and a bit
                sticky.
            </li>
            <li>
                Knead the dough for about 3 to 4 minutes until it becomes smooth
                and elastic. You can use your hand, a wooden spatula, or a stand
                mixer with the hook attachment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the kneaded dough into a lightly greased bowl, cover it 
                with plastic wrap and a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in 
                a warm place for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until it doubles 
                in size.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>SHAPE THE DONUTS</h4>
        <ol>
            <li >
                Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. 
                Transfer it to a clean and floured surface.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll out the dough to about 1/2 inch thickness into a large 
                square. Use a pizza cutter to cut squares about the size of 2.5 
                by 2.5 inches.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover them with a clean kitchen towel and let them rise again 
                but this time only for about 15 to 20 minutes, just while the 
                oil heats up.
            </li>
        </ol>
