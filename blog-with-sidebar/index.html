                            Clue is a 1985 American black comedy mystery film 
                            based on the board game of the same name. Directed 
                            by Jonathan Lynn, who co-wrote the script with John 
                            Landis, and produced by Debra Hill, it stars the 
                            ensemble cast of Eileen Brennan, Tim Curry, Madeline
                            Kahn, Christopher Lloyd, Michael McKean, Martin 
                            Mull, and Lesley Ann Warren, with Colleen Camp and 
                            Lee Ving in supporting roles.

                        Inspired by the nature of the board game, the film has 
                        multiple different endings. Originally screening one of 
                        three possibilities at different theaters, home media 
                        releases include all three endings. The film initially 
                        received mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box 
                        office, grossing $14.6 million in the United States 
                        against its budget of $15 million, but later developed a
                        considerable cult following.

                            In 1954, six strangers are invited to a secluded New
                            England mansion. Greeted by the butler Wadsworth and
                            the maid Yvette, each guest receives a pseudonym to
                            maintain confidentiality: "Colonel Mustard", "Mrs.
                            White", "Mrs. Peacock", "Mr. Green", "Professor 
                            Plum", and "Miss Scarlet". During dinner, they 
                            discover they all hold government influence before 
                            being joined by Mr. Boddy, who has been blackmailing
                            everyone for some time. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Wadsworth has called the 
                        police to arrest Boddy, but Boddy threatens to 
                        expose everyone's secrets if they turn him in. He 
                        then presents the six guests with weapons—a 
                        candlestick, rope, lead pipe, wrench, revolver, and 
                        dagger—and suggests someone kill Wadsworth to 
                        protect their secrets before turning out the lights.
                        After a gunshot rings out, Boddy is found on the 
                        floor, seemingly dead. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the guests investigate Boddy's death, Wadsworth 
                        explains how he became indentured to Boddy and summoned 
                        the guests, hoping to force a confession from Boddy and 
                        turn him over to the police. As the group suspect the 
                        cook, only to find she was fatally stabbed with the 
                        dagger, someone discovers Boddy is alive before killing 
                        him with the candlestick. Wadsworth locks the weapons in
                        a cupboard, but before he can throw away the key, a 
                        stranded motorist arrives and Wadsworth locks him in the
                        lounge before throwing a key out the front door. The 
                        group draw lots to pair up before searching the manor. 
                        However, someone burns the blackmail evidence, unlocks 
                        the cupboard, and kills the motorist with the wrench. 
                        Discovering a secret passage, Mustard and Scarlet find 
                        themselves locked in the lounge with the motorist's 
                        corpse. When they scream for help, Yvette shoots the 
                        door open with the revolver. The group deduce that 
                        Wadsworth threw out the wrong key and the murderer 
                        pickpocketed the cupboard key from him.

                            A cop investigating the motorist's abandoned car 
                            arrives to use the phone. The mansion receives a 
                            call from FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover, which Wadsworth
                            takes alone. After successfully distracting the cop 
                            and concealing the bodies, the group resumes their 
                            search until someone turns off the electricity. In 
                            the darkness, Yvette, the cop, and an arriving 
                            singing telegram girl are murdered with the rope, 
                            pipe, and revolver, respectively. Wadsworth restores
                            the power and gathers the group, having deduced 
                            what happened. Recreating the night's events and 
                            amidst a brief interruption from an evangelist, he 
                            explains how the other five victims were Boddy's 
                            informants who are each connected to one of the 
                            guests, which dovetails into one of three possible 
                            outcomes.
