                    <li>
                        We offer an allergy friendly menu option, as well as 
                        gluten free options. If you have any specific dietary
                        needs please let your server know or include it in your
                        booking.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        While we will always notify you of allergens we do not 
                        reveal the mystery ingredients until you guess them 
                        properly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Our menu is always updating, so while you may know what
                        it was last time, that's never a guarentee.
