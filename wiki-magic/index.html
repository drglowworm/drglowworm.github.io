                <p>
                    Card manipulation, commonly known as card magic, is the 
                    branch of magic that deals with creating effects using 
                    sleight of hand techniques involving playing cards. Card 
                    manipulation is often used in magical performances, 
                    especially in close-up, parlor, and street magic. Some of 
                    the most recognized names in this field include Dai Vernon,
                    Tony Slydini, Ed Marlo, S.W. Erdnase, Richard Turner,
                    John Scarne, Ricky Jay and René Lavand. Before 
                    becoming world-famous for his escapes, Houdini billed 
                    himself as "The King of Cards". Among the more well-known
                    card tricks relying on card manipulation are Ambitious Card,
                    and Three-card Monte, a common street hustle also known as 
                    Find the Lady.

                <h2 id="history">History</h2>
                <p>
                    Playing cards became popular with magicians in the 15th 
                    century as they were props which were inexpensive, 
                    versatile, and easily accessible. Card magic has bloomed 
                    into one of the most popular branches of magic, accumulating
                    thousands of techniques and ideas. These range from complex
                    mathematics like those used by Persi Diaconis, the use of 
                    psychological techniques like those taught by Banachek, to 
                    extremely difficult sleight of hand like that of Ed Marlo 
                    and Dai Vernon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Card magic, in one form or another, likely dates from the 
                    time playing cards became commonly known, towards the second
                    half of the fourteenth century, but its history in this 
                    period is largely undocumented. Compared to sleight of hand 
                    magic in general and to cups and balls, it is a new form of 
                    magic. However, due to its versatility as a prop it has 
                    become popular amongst modern magicians.

                    Martin Gardner called S.W. Erdnase's 1902 treatise on card 
                    manipulation Artifice, Ruse and Subterfuge at the Card 
                    Table: A Treatise on the Science and Art of Manipulating 
                    Cards "the most famous, the most carefully studied book ever
                    published on the art of manipulating cards at gaming 
                    tables".

                <h4 id="cheat">Association with card cheating</h4>
                <p>
                    Although being mostly used for entertainment and comedy 
                    purposes, sleight of hand is also notoriously used to cheat 
                    at casinos and gambling facilities throughout the world. 
                    Common ways to professionally cheat at card games using 
                    sleight of hand include palming, switching, ditching, and 
                    stealing cards from the table. Such techniques involve 
                    extreme misdirection and years of practice. For these 
                    reasons, the term sleight of hand frequently carries 
                    negative associations of dishonesty and deceit at many 
                    gambling halls, and many magicians known around the world 
                    are publicly banned from casinos, such as British mentalist 
                    and close-up magician Derren Brown, who is banned from every
                    casino in Britain.

                <h4 id="cardistry">Association with Cardistry</h4>
                <p>
                    Unlike card tricks done on the streets or on stage and card 
                    cheating, cardistry is solely about impressing without 
                    illusions, deceit, misdirection and other elements commonly 
                    used in card tricks and card cheating. Cardistry is the art 
                    of card flourishing, and is intended to be visually 
                    impressive and to give the appearance of being difficult to 
                    perform. Card flourishing is often associated with card 
                    tricks, but many sleight of hand artists perform flourishing
                    without considering themselves magicians or having any real 
                    interest in card tricks.
                </p>
                <h2 id="technique">Techniques</h2>
                <p>
                    Illusions performed with playing cards are constructed using
                    basic card manipulation techniques (or sleights). It is the 
                    intention of the performer that such sleights are performed 
                    in a manner which is undetectable to the audience—however, 
                    that result takes practice and a thorough understanding of 
                    method. Manipulation techniques include:
                </p>
                <h4 id="lifts">Lifts</h4>
                <p>
                    Lifts are techniques which extract one or more cards from a 
                    deck. The produced card(s) are normally known to the 
                    audience, for example having previously been selected or 
                    identified as part of the illusion. In sleight of hand, a 
                    "double lift" can be made to extract two cards from the 
                    deck, but held together to appear as one card.
                </p>
                <h4 id="falsedeal">False Deals</h4>
                <p>
                    Dealing cards (for example at the start of a traditional 
                    card game) is considered a fair means of distributing cards.
                    False deals are techniques which appear to deliver cards 
                    fairly, when actually the cards delivered are predetermined 
                    or known to the performer. False dealing techniques include:
                    second dealing, bottom dealing, middle dealing, false counts
                    (more or less cards are dealt than expected), and double 
                    dealing (the top and bottom cards of a small packet are 
                    dealt together).
                </p>
                <h4 id="sidesteal">Side Steals</h4>
                <p>
                    A technique invented by magician F. W. Conradi. It is used 
                    to control a predetermined card to the top of a deck 
                    (most of the time).
                </p>
                <h4 id="passes">Passes</h4>
                <p>
                    The effect of the card pass is that an identified card is 
                    inserted somewhere into a deck. However, following rapid and
                    concealed manipulation by the performer, it is secretly 
                    moved or displaced - usually to the top (or bottom) of the 
                    deck. A pass is achieved by swapping the portion of the deck
                    from the identified card downwards, with the portion of the 
                    deck above the identified card. Pass techniques include: the
                    classic pass, the invisible turn-over pass, the Zingone 
                    Perfect Table pass, the flesh grip pass, the jog pass, the 
                    Braue pass, the Charlier pass, the finger palm pass and the 
                    Hermann pass. Simply, a card pass is a secret cut of the 
                    deck (not to be confused with a coin pass which is a false 
                    transfer of a coin from one hand to the other).
                </p>
                <h4 id="palming">Palming</h4>
                <p>
                    Palming is a technique for holding or concealing one or more
                    cards in the palm of the hand. Cards palmed from a deck are 
                    typically held in reserve (unseen by the audience) until 
                    production is required for the illusion being performed. 
                    Palming techniques include: the Braue diagonal tip-up, the 
                    swing, the thumb-count, face card palm, the crosswise, new 
                    vertical, the gamblers' squaring, the gamblers' flat, the 
                    Hugard top palm, the flip-over, the Hofzinser bottom, the 
                    Braue bottom, the Tenkai palm and the Zingone bottom.
                </p>
                <h4 id="falseshuffle">False Shuffles</h4>
                <p>
                    Shuffling cards is considered a fair means to randomize the 
                    cards contained in a deck. False shuffles are techniques 
                    which appear to fairly shuffle a deck, when actually the 
                    cards in the deck are maintained in an order appropriate to
                    the illusion being performed. False shuffles can be 
                    performed that permit one or more cards to be positioned in 
                    a deck, or even for the entire deck to remain in an 
                    unshuffled state (for example the state the deck was in 
                    before the shuffle). False shuffle techniques include: the 
                    perfect riffle, the strip-out, the Hindu shuffle, the 
                    gamblers', and various stock shuffling techniques 
                    (where the locations of one or more cards are controlled 
                    during the false shuffle).
                </p>
                <h4 id="falsecut">False Cuts</h4>
                <p>
                    Cutting a deck of cards is a technique whereby the deck is 
                    split into two portions (the split point being randomly 
                    determined - often by a member of the audience), which are 
                    then swapped - the effect being to make sure that no one is 
                    sure of which card is on the top of the deck. False cuts are
                    techniques whereby the performer appears to organise a fair 
                    cut, when actually a predetermined card (or cards) is 
                    organised to be located on the top of the deck. False 
                    cutting techniques include: the false running cut, and the 
                    gambler's false cut.
                </p>
                <h4 id="colorchange">Color Change</h4>
                <p>
                    A color change is the effect of changing one card to another
                    in front of the spectator's eyes. Usually the cards changed
                    are of different colors, or a face card into a number card, 
                    in order to make the change more apparent. There are many 
                    different techniques to accomplish this effect, but among 
                    the most common are the classic color change and the snap 
                    change, as they are easier to master than others. 
                    Professional magicians usually perform other color changes 
                    such as the Cardini or Erdnase change.

                <h4 id="crimps">Crimps</h4>
                <p>
                    Crimps are techniques whereby part of a card is 
                    intentionally physically marked, creased, or bent to 
                    facilitate identification during an illusion. Crimp 
                    techniques include: the regular crimp, the gamblers' crimp, 
                    the breather crimp and the peek crimp.
                </p>
                <h4 id="jogs">Jogs</h4>
                <p>
                    A jog is one or more cards which protrude slightly from 
                    somewhere within a deck or stack of cards. The protrusion, 
                    although not noticeable to the audience, permits the 
                    performer to retain knowledge about the location of the card
                    during other manipulations. While jogs are not always hidden
                    from the audience, they are most often. Some varieties 
                    include "in jogs", "side jogs", and "out jogs"
                </p>
                <h4 id="reverses">Reverses</h4>
                <p>
                    Card reverses are techniques whereby one or more cards in a 
                    deck are made to change their orientation, for example from 
                    face up to face down.
                </p>
                <h4 id="forces">Forces</h4>
                <p>
                    Card forces are the sleight which involves forcing a 
                    spectator to choose a card that has been predetermined by 
                    the performer, while maintaining supposed free choice. Some 
                    forces include; the classic force, the riffle force, and the
                    slip force.
                </p>
                <h4 id="misdirection">Misdirection</h4>
                <p>
                    Misdirection, though not entirely specific to card magic, is
                    indeed very prominent in most card performances. In many 
                    cases, the ‘skill’ of a card illusionist is determined by 
                    how well they can switch the audiences attention from one 
                    part of the performance to the next, which becomes more 
                    difficult when dealing with hecklers. Magicians can use card
                    techniques like flourishing, verbal misdirection and by 
                    cracking jokes, in order to mislead the audience, making 
                    concealment of important sleight of hand easier in the 
                    process.
