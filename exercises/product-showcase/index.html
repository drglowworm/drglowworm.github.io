                    A new design for an age-old plot... and more.
                    <br>
                    A spectator selects and signs a card. WHAM! It's no longer 
                    in the deck! Open up the Altoids box, and show them the 
                    folded card inside. The spectator sees you remove and hand 
                    them the card to reopen - it's their signed card!

                <h2>Wonder Needle</h2>
                <p>
                    The Wonder Needle is an easy to learn miracle that packs 
                    small and carries a huge impact on any audience.
                    <br>
                    Start by handing your spectator a needle and a piece of 
                    thread. Ask them to thread the needle and hold on to both 
                    ends of the thread. As long they don't let go of the ends, 
                    there should be no way for the needle to escape without 
                    breaking the thread. Under cover of a handkerchief, 
                    you proceed to do exactly that and pull the needle free from
                    the thread without damaging the needle or the thread, and 
                    everything is left completely examinable!

                <h2>Double Cross</h2>
                <p>
                    Ask a spectator to hold out their hand and make a closed 
                    fist. Pull out a marker and draw an 'X' on the center of 
                    your palm and close it into a fist. Now without any rubbing,
                    erasing or funny business, you slowly open your hand and 
                    reveal your X is COMPLETELY GONE. Now ask the spectator to 
                    open their hand - THE X IS ON THEIR PALM!
